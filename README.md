# Summer-2019
Code created for REU program with Lou DiMauro at OSU 2019

chunkanalysis.py: This code was created to analyze long-term and short term noise for a 635nm 5mW Coherent cw laser interferometer that I
built. Graphs standard deviation over short chunks, creates a histogram of the standard devaitions, and graphs how the mean varies. Also,
graphs the input data. 

fourier.py: This was just a quick code written to extract a fourier analysis of the interferometer mentioned above. Gave a good sense of
where the majority of our noise was resulting from.

Ellispse Fitting: These two programs were written for fitting some elliptical data to a fit. Two photodiodes 90 degrees out of phase 
relative to one another in an interferometer create an ellipsoid when a phase shift is introduced. Used this to extract the 
internal pressure of a gas cell for some absorption spectroscopy.
